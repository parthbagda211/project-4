# IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Performance

This repository contains an analysis of the **IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition** dataset, focusing on predictive modeling to address employee attrition. The dataset provides valuable insights into employee characteristics and performance, helping organizations understand and manage attrition factors.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The initial phase of the project involved **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. EDA enabled us to understand the dataset's structure, distribution, and relationships among variables. Insights gained during this stage laid the foundation for subsequent decisions.

## Feature Selection

To improve the model's predictive power, we employed **feature selection** techniques. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), a wrapper method, was utilized to identify the most impactful features. This step ensured that the model was trained on relevant attributes, enhancing its performance.

## Data Preprocessing

Addressing class imbalance is crucial for accurate modeling. The **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** method was employed to oversample the minority class, creating a balanced dataset. Additionally, data scaling was performed to normalize features, preventing any particular attribute from dominating the learning process.

## Predictive Modeling

We trained multiple machine learning models from the **scikit-learn library** to predict employee attrition. Various algorithms were considered, such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, Logistic Regression, and more. Model performances were evaluated using metrics such as Precision, Recall, and accuracy.

## Conclusion

This project showcases a comprehensive approach to understanding and predicting employee attrition. From initial data exploration to advanced predictive modeling, we've demonstrated how to enhance model performance by employing appropriate techniques at every stage. The insights gained from this analysis can aid organizations in proactively addressing attrition and implementing strategies to retain valuable employees.
